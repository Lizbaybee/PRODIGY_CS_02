A pixel manipulation tool for image encryption and decryption using Pillow and Python

# 🔐 Simple Image Encryption using Pixel Manipulation

This project demonstrates a **basic image encryption and decryption system** built in Python.  
It uses **pixel manipulation techniques**  including **key-based RGB modification** and **pixel swapping**  to hide and restore image data.



## 📸 Overview

The program:
1. Reads an image pixel by pixel.
2. Encrypts it by:
   - Adding a numeric key to each pixel’s RGB values.
   - Swapping adjacent pixels for extra obfuscation.
3. Decrypts it by reversing both operations.

It’s a simple but clear demonstration of how **image data can be protected and restored** using basic cryptographic logic.



## 🧩 Features

- 🔑 **Key-based encryption** — each pixel value is shifted using a numeric key.
- 🔄 **Pixel swapping** — rearranges pixel pairs to distort the image further.
- 🖼️ **Reversible decryption** — restores the image perfectly using the same key.
- 💡 **Easy to understand** — great for learning how pixel-level image processing works.
